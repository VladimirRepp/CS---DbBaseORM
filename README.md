# CS---SimpleORM
A simple ORM based on C#, .Net9, ADO.Net and Provider factories

=== Release Notes: ===
======================
- v0.1
- IDE: MVS 2022
- C# / .Net9 / Console App
- ADO.Net
- Provider Factory
- Source project platform: Microsoft.NETCore.App (9.0.0)
- Instal packeges:
  * System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager (9.0.2)
  * Microsoft.Data.SqlClient (6.0.1)
  * System.Data.OleDb (9.0.2)

=== Description: ===
======================
- Registration of the provider's factory is required, depending on the chosen platform
- The provider is selected from the configuration file (App.config)
- The connection string is taken from the configuration file (App.config)
- When working with a Microsoft office package (for example, Access database), you must select the build size of the project in accordance with the office size (x64, x86)
- Default data types of fields in the database: id:int, other fields: varchar
- Otherwise, use the overloaded method with the List<DbParametr> args parameters for inserting and updating data

=== Description of architectural principles: ===
======================
- The abstract DbBaseController class implements the entire logic of actions with local data and databases
- All data models must be inherited from the IBaseModel interface, which contains common properties and methods

=== Example of work: ===
======================
- To implement the data model, you need to create a new class and inherit from the IBaseModel interface and implement all its actions
  * Example: class DbUser : IBaseModel { ... }

Ways to work with controllers: Each controller is associated with a single table!
- (I) To implement a controller for a specific model, you can create a new class and inherit from DbBaseController abstract class with the model template type. With this option, it is convenient to add and change new actions.
  * Example: class DbUserController : DbBaseController <DbUser> { ... }
- (II) You can immediately use an instance of the Db Base Controller class with the template type of the implemented model
  * Example:  DbBaseController <DbUser> users = new("NAME_YOUR_PROVIDER");

=== Actions: ===
======================
That implement a query to the database and, if successful, make changes to the local data:
- Synchronous:
  * Query_SelectAll: Requesting a selection of all data from a database table to a local list Data(List<T>)
  * Query_SelectById: Requesting data selection by ID from a database table to a local variable
  * Query_SelectByQuery (2 overloads): Fetching data by query string to a local variable
  * Query_SelectsByQuery (2 overloads): Fetching data by query string to a local list
  * Query_TrySelectById: An attempt to get data by ID from a database table to a local variable
  * Query_Insert (2 overloads): Inserting data into Data (List<T>) and requesting an insert into the database
  * Query_Update (2 overloads): Updating data in Data (List<T>) and requesting an update in the database
  * Query_DeleteById: Deleting data by ID in Data (List<T>) and requesting deletion in the database
  * Query_ClearTable: Clearing Data (List<T>) and requesting a table cleanup in the database
  * Request_GetLastId: Return the last largest ID to the database tables
  * Query_Save (2 overloads): Saving local data in the database. A transaction is being used
  * Query_Execute (2 overloads): Make a query to the database
  * Query_ExecuteReader: Run a query to the database with the returned result in a local variable
  * Query_ExecuteReaders: Run a query to the database with the returned result in a local list
- Asynchronous analogues:
  * Query_SelectAllAsync: Asynchronous request to fetch all data to a local list Data (List<T>)
  * Query_SelectByIdAsync: Asynchronous selection request by ID to a local variable
  * Query_SelectByQueryAsync (2 overloads): Asynchronous fetching of data by query string to a local variable
  * Query_SelectsByQueryAsync (2 overloads): Asynchronous fetching of data by query string to a local list
  * Query_InsertAsync (2 overloads): Asynchronous insertion of data into Data (List<T>) and query for insertion into the database
  * Query_UpdateAsync (2 overloads): Asynchronous updating of data in Data (List<T>) and requesting an update in the database
  * Query_DeleteByIdAsync: Asynchronous deletion of data from Data (List<T>) and request deletion from the database
  * Query_ClearTableAsync: Asynchronous Data cleanup (List<T>) and a table cleanup request in the database
  * Request_GetLastIdAsync: Asynchronous request to the database for the return of the last largest ID
  * Query_SaveAsync (2 overloads): Asynchronous storage of local data in the database. A transaction is being used
  * Query_ExecuteAsync (2 overloads): Make an asynchronous database request
  * Query_ExecuteReaderAsync: Execute an asynchronous query to the database with the result returned to a local variable
  * Query_ExecuteReadersAsync: Execute an asynchronous query to the database with the result returned to a local list

=== Attention! ===
======================
Before using it, make sure that the code in your project is working correctly. Correct operation is NOT guaranteed, comprehensive testing is required within your system.
